        Time: 30 minutes
        Subsections A1 & A2
Consider a string aaabbcccdffffaaa. The same letter appears many times consecutively. To save space,
we can save this string as a3b2c3d1f4a3. You have to write a program that does this run-length encoding of
the given string.
    Input
      Take a non-empty string of lowercase letters as input from console.
    Output
      Task 1 (70%) Print the run-length encoded version of the string.
      Task 2 (30%) If the encoded string is larger than the original string, print the original string too.
    Sample I/O
    Input
      aaaaabb
    Output
      a5b2
    Input
      aaabbcccccddddddeaaaabccc
    Output
      a3b2c5d6e1a4b1c3
    Input
      aabc
    Output
      a2b1c1
    aabc
Hints
Run a loop over the string and try to increase the count as long as same character continues to appear.
